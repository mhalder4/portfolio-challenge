# Matt Halder's Coding Portfolio

## Description

This project was created to display items pertinent to myself (Matt Halder) in a portfolio style. There is an "About Me" section that gives some information on me, a "My Work" section that shows off my projects with links to the projects, and a "Find Me" section that has some contact info linked. The page is styled using CSS and adaptive to different screen sizes.

## Installation

The pertinent files for the project, including this README can all be found in the Github repository located at: https://github.com/mhalder4/portfolio-challenge. The website can be found at the Github pages address that follows: https://mhalder4.github.io/portfolio-challenge/.
## Usage

The website has a navigation bar along the top that directs to the sections below. The images in the "My Work" section can be clicked to be taken to those projects and the icons at the bottom can be clicked to be taken to the corresponding location.
